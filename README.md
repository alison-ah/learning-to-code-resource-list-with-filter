## Acknowledgements
Noticing the challenge of sharing resources with <a href="skillcrush.com" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a> students in the companyâ€™s Slack channel, I decided to augment a course project that filtered hotel rooms to share resources for learning to code. It was built in CodeSandbox with JavaScript React and image icons created in Canva. Then it was saved to GitHub and deployed on Netlify.
